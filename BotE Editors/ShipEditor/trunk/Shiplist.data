AT-Class
Shortly after the foundation of the Coalition of Planets, it was decided to commission a new, revolutionary ship class. The result was a platform which enabled mankind to leave their star system and explore the universe. These ships are despite their relatively strong armament foremost research ships and that way their captains see it too why they are rather not a threat for a real combat vessel.

Duluth
The Duluth-class is the result of an ambitious development program of the Utopia Planitia fleet yards. The huge Duluth-class dwarves everything done before and was mainly designed to replace the aged Chilmark and Farscape classes at scientific missions. At drawing the concept of the Duluth-class the best engineers and technicians of the Coalition have worked together and created the doubtlessly most advanced ship in the fleet. Aside from its role on scientific assignments this ship type also is an excellent command ship to coordinate large fleet operations and withal a strong enemy.

Longeyes are withal considerably more compact and durable than their predecessors which makes conducting scientific activities even under worst conditions possible.

Engines, weapons, armor as well as shields are extraordinarily good. It can take over all imaginable tasks. At present there is hardly any ship out there which is able to hold a candle to the Matilda-class. A disadvantage however are the high build costs.

Pattons are heavily armed and very agile. Withal the Patton class owes its existence to the increased efforts of the Coalition fleet to avert potential danger from enemy large combat vessels. For this reason torpedo armament is especially distinct. As a sideline state-of-the-art defensive systems were integrated in this ship class. Enemy ships will have a hard time to pit themselves against a fleet of Pattons.

Valkyrie
In contrast to other ship classes of the Coalition, the Valkyrie-class was mainly designed to fight extremely strong enemy battle cruisers. Aside from conventional weapons the ship has impulse laser cannons and quantum torpedo bays. Maneuvrability in combat as well as excellent defensive systems have no equal with ships of this size.

Wolf
The Wolf-class is replacing the not-so-old Benton-class. The prominent advantage of this ship are the relatively low production costs. Withal the ship offers excellent speed and maneuvrability in combat. Hardly any other ship can keep up with that. On the bad side are the relatively few offensive weapons.

Han'Quhr
The Han'Quhr is the flagship of the Heyoun Trade Union and therefore the most advanced and dangerous ship in the fleet. Earlier concerns about non-profitability of such monstrous and expensive ship classes were dismissed after several unfavorable battles against enemy large warships of this type and such this gorgeous ship was born. All ship systems, especially the weapon ones are state-of-the art the least.

Originally drafted as a small short-range freighter, this ship was equipped with a variety of smaller weapon systems and upgraded with better shields. These improvements were necessary since other unarmed transporter often fell victim to pirate attacks an other enemy privateers. The current version of the Vantor has dropped its transporter role and is now used for frontline patrol missions, as escort and for fast raids.

Fear
Fear class transporters carry freight or invasion troops through the Empire. Its role as troop transporter makes it very valuable for the Khaoron why it was equipped with a disruptor cannon to defend itself. However it does not necessarily protect the ship from any enemy ship or orbital battery, also because of the ship's low speed and weak shields.

High speed and good sensors contribute to its special dangerousness. The only weak spot - if it could be named so at all - are the shields, but therefore the Leviathan is extremely  strong armored.

C'labrum
In his sedulous attempt to expand territorial borders, the Rotharian Star Network is continually colonizing new planets. Ships like the C'labrum transport colonists and equipment to these worlds for terraforming and construction of a local infrastructure. Thereby the ship itself serves as source for building material once the planets are reached. Like all colony ships this model too is unarmed and terribly slow so that it is defenseless against attacks.

D'Ocellus
The D'Ocellus-class battle colossus is double the size of a Coalition Duluth-class cruiser with a slight advantage in firepower at comparable speeds and maneuvrability but weaker shields and sensors. This disadvantage is well-compensated however by its powerful cloak which gives even this colossus the chance to surprise and attack enemy ships that are stronger and better-shielded before they can raise their shields. An attacking squadron of D'Ocellus battleships that approaches under the cover of its cloak, can take out nearly every opponent including star bases and large fleets at first strike or at least heavily damage them.

M'adomen
M'adomen-class fighters are utmost nimble ships that are best used in large squadrons where they can deliver terrible damage to the enemy. With their high speed, the impulse distruptors, the good cloak and relatively strong shields, such an attack formation can have devastating effects on every other fleet or even base that is surprised by it. Swarms of M'adomens encircle enemy cruisers and eliminate them by concentrated fire, while they themselves are hard to hit.

An early Rotharian model of a small nimble fighting ship that is preferably used in large squadrons to destroy larger ships by combined firepower from all sides and break up enemy formations. Also as escorts for freighter convoys or battleships it was often observed. Furthermore they are also used to intercept enemy scouts, which they are mostly clearly superior with respect to maneuvrability, shields and armament.

This little, extremely agile fighting ship is particularly used in big squadrons to disrupt bigger ships through combined firepower from all sides and break up enemy formations. Withal it serves as escort ship and is also used to intercept enemy scouts, a task, where this ship excels at usually. A smart fleet admiral utilizes these ships to weaken enemy fleets before his main strike force engages in battle.

Should they be detected once despite their excellent cloaking and caught by a warship, they could easily escape with maximum speed. Smaller enemies do not have a chance anyway against its impulse disruptors.

R'Acron cruisers are heavy assault ships that can fire devastating broadsides onto enemy ships or planetary bombardments with their disruptors and torpedos. Rotharian commanders indeed prefer tactics and finesse, but this ship could also stand a pure repartee with a respective enemy. Its relatively weak shields are compensated by good cloaking and a powerful engine. R'Acron-class cruisers were the backbone of the Rotharian Strike Force for a long time and enjoyed great popularity with their commanders.

V'epipharyn
The V'epipharyn-class is a predecessor of the infamous D'Corax class and has basic shape as well as equipment of this class. Its strong armament consisting of disruptors and torpedo bays make this fighting ship together with its high speed and cloaking a more than worthy opponent for every other enemy cruiser. Additionally this ship is successfully used as command ship for fleet operations.

V'tarsus
This class of advanced, highly modern destroyers serves as fast-response ship of the Star Network. Its extreme speed and high maneuvrability in combination with its relatively strong impulse disruptors makes it a deadly opponent for other similar-sized ships. Aside from that the ship is perfect for quick raids deep in the enemy territory, whereby it is often deployed in small squadrons to surprise and destroy single larger ships or even outposts by their combined firepower.
