Short instructions:

With the CombatScript File you can say, which ships of which races should fight. There is a sample of the CombatScript too in this zip archiv. With the §REPEAT§ flag you can say, how often the combat repeats. With the §SLOWING§ flag, you can say with which speed the fight is shown. Attention: If you repeat the combat, there would be no graphic display. I think you know the other flags by your self. Please have a look to the example combatscript file.

After calculating a combat, you get some Log files, so you get a good overview about the strengths and weaknesses of the ships.

Put your current ShipList.data into the same folder where the CombatSimulator.exe is. Put the CombatScript.txt in this folder too. Than execute the CombatSimulator.exe. While calculation do not click any button on your keyboard or your mouse!

Have fun...
